# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Textbook-First Development
All features and implementations must serve the primary goal of creating comprehensive educational content about Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Every code example, diagram, and concept explanation must contribute directly to the 15,000-20,000 word Docusaurus textbook. Focus on pedagogical value over feature completeness.

### II. Embodied Intelligence Focus
Maintain strict adherence to the "Digital Brain → Physical Body" theme throughout all content. All modules must connect digital AI systems (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, Vision-Language models) to physical embodiment (humanoid robots, sensors, actuators). Content must emphasize the integration of perception, cognition, and action.

### III. Spec-Driven Content Creation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All textbook content must follow SpecKit Plus methodology: Specifications written → Content approved → Content drafted → Implemented in Docusaurus format. Each module (ROS 2, Digital Twin, NVIDIA Isaac AI, Vision-Language-Action) must have detailed specifications before writing begins.

### IV. Multi-Platform Compatibility
Ensure all code examples and instructions work consistently on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble/Iron. Hardware documentation must cover both physical robot options (Go2, G1, OP3, TonyPi) and cloud alternatives (AWS g5.2xlarge with NVIDIA A10G). Include Jetson Orin Nano edge AI kit compatibility.

### V. Structured Learning Progression
Content must follow the 13-week course structure with progressive difficulty: Weeks 1-5 (ROS 2 Nervous System), Weeks 6-7 (Digital Twin), Weeks 8-10 (NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain), Weeks 11-13 (Vision-Language-Action). Each module builds upon previous concepts with clear prerequisites.

### VI. Automated File Generation


All missing textbook files and folders must be auto-generated following the established patterns. Use the auto-create rules to maintain content structure integrity and continue execution when encountering missing assets. Generated files must contain proper headers and auto-generation notices.

## Content and Technical Standards
<!-- Additional constraints for textbook development -->

All content must adhere to Docusaurus Markdown format with proper frontmatter. Code examples must include type hints, English comments, and error handling. Minimum 5 code examples per module. Each module requires 3 diagrams (total 12). Hardware documentation must cover workstation specs (RTX 4070 Ti+, 64GB RAM) and edge AI kit components (Jetson Orin Nano, RealSense D435i, ReSpeaker Mic, IMU module).

## Development Workflow and Organization
<!-- Development workflow, file organization, and quality standards -->

Organize content by feature/module rather than file type with maximum 3-4 nesting levels. All file and folder names use English kebab-case. Documentation placement follows: specs in /specs, textbook content in /docs, configurations at root. Code comments must be in English with consistent terminology. User-facing responses use Roman Urdu. All unused files must be deleted and .gitignore maintained properly.

## Governance
<!-- Constitution governs all development practices; amendments require explicit documentation -->

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All PRs and reviews must verify compliance with textbook-first development and embodied intelligence focus. Any deviation from the 13-week module structure or content requirements must be justified. Automation must create missing files/folders automatically. All deliverables (GitHub repo, live Docusaurus book) must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
